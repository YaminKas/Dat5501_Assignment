# Education Attainment & Socioeconomic Analysis for Workforce Planning

## Project Overview
This project analyses UK educational attainment data alongside socioeconomic indicators to explore patterns in learner outcomes. The goal is to provide insights for post-education employers on how students from different backgrounds perform, identify areas where additional support may be needed, and inform strategies to help learners thrive in the workforce.  

The analysis focuses on the relationship between attainment at Level 2 and Level 3, gender differences, and deprivation scores across local authorities.
